Objects are representations of real-life elements. Each object has a set of attributes
that differentiates it from the rest of the objects of the same class, and is capable of a
set of actions. A class is the definition of what an object looks like and what it can do,
like a pattern for objects.

Definition of the class

A class is defined by the keyword class followed by a valid class name—that
follows the same rules as any other PHP label, like variable names—and a block
of code.

<?php

class book{
	
}

class customer{
	
}
